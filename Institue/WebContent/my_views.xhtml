						<p>Accroding to my concern chemistry has the same quickening
							and suggestive influence upon the algebraist as a visit to the
							Royal Academy, or the old masters may be supposed to have on a
							Browning or a Tennyson. Indeed it seems to me that an exact
							homology exists between painting and poetry on the one hand and
							modem chemistry and modem algebra on the other. In poetry and
							algebra we have the pure idea elaborated and expressed through
							the vehicle of language, in painting and chemistry the idea
							enveloped in matter, depending in part on manual processes and
							the resources of art for its due manifestation.</p>

						<h3>To My Students</h3>
						<header class="col-md-12">
						<p>Section A</p>
						<p>Chemistry is a vast subject with different fragrance in
							its every corner. Study in depth with proper concept is expected
							at the best effort in H.S / I.S.C / C.B.S.E level. All the
							competitive entrance exams including J.E.E (MAIN AND ADVANCED),
							A.I.P.M.T or all India Medical exams are based on concept and
							accuracy. So, each chapter of Chemistry should be studied
							thoroughly but in proper method.</p>
						<p>Here is a question.What are the methods to study Modern
							Chemistry? It is not the way of Xerox of 40-50 pages in
							a made-easy note-book style (question answer pattern) for
							each chapter. It is not the way to study Chemistry
							in tick-mark style / or reading only suggestively. It is
							not the way to omit the chapters which you do not understand.
							Remember that,Chemistry is a technical subject, fully based on
							mathematics (not on bunch of made-easy notes).</p>
						<h3>Chemistry Is Fun!</h3>
						<p>As Chemistry includes different branches (Physical,
							Inorganic, Organic, Analytical etc.), you are to follow different
							techniques and methods which are suitable to them.If you study
							Chemistry without proper techniques and methods, you will not
							gather proper concept and will experience different sorts of
							problems throughout the whole course (especially during the
							exam-days).</p>
						<h3>Chemistry That Most Excellent Child of Intellect and Art.</h3>
						<p>During the course, students face many difficulties
							regarding Chemistry as they do not know the basics.They do not
							know how to use Road-maps and Charts when they read Inorganic and
							Organic Chemistry. They avoid the numerical problems in Physical
							Chemistry. From my vast teaching experience, I have noticed that
							most of the students do not have good skill in Mole concept,
							they avoid Volumetric calculation,Redox equilibrium, Problems on
							electrochemical cell etc.Organic chemistry,to many students is
							a night-mare experience due to wrong method of study. </p>
						<p>Another thing I have noticed that,few students get
							trapped and waste their valuable time regarding for-show
							practical in private tuition class in some cases.This proved to
							be fatal regarding conceptual angles necessary in JEE exams as
							well as in theoretical part of chemistry in board exams. In such
							circumstances you should know regularity in classes in your
							School will ensure good practical marks. Students leaving tuition
							from such places when join to my class, discover their weakness
							in physical chemistry, especially in organic chemistry. These two
							branches of chemistry carry huge marks not only in board exam but
							also in JEEs.Engg and Medical exams (JEEs) do not involve
							practical. </p>
						<p>So, dear students, read Chemistry from the very basic
							level. Use proper learning techniquesÂ andÂ systematic
							methods which will enrich you with knowledge and will help you
							to score as well and to get top ranks in J.E.E or equivalent
							exams. You have toÂ exercise my huge collection of verities
							of numerical problems for each chapter. </p>
						<p>So, you should be very systematic and sincere from the very
							beginning of the course. You should be regular in my class.My
							many students showed brilliance in J.E.E and other competitive
							jobs placing themselves well.With a strong feeling borne in
							mind, I am inspired to teach Chemistry to my students with some
							necessary techniques related to every branch of Chemistry.In
							this view point, I have introduced - Technique Based Study In
							Chemistry which will help students to learn Chemistry in
							easier and interesting way.I wish a prospective future for all
							my students. </p>
